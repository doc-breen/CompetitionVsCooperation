The evolutionary simulator

This project is an attempt to use Godot built-in physics to emulate Active Brownian Particles, and then allow them to reproduce and evolve.
Currently has agents which move about randomly, collecting food and reproducing.  Agents have a "childhood" after which they turn a random color based on their parent's color.
